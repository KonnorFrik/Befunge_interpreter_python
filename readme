Befunge interpreter on python 3
Works according to the rules from Wikipedia

Usage:
    - python3 befunge.py [f/s] [file name/program string]
      [f/s] - without '-', where:
        f - File mode, need enter a path to file next
        s - String mode, need enter a program string wrapped by quotes ( " )
      file_name - looks like "programs/hello_world.bf"
      program string - looks like "3.@"

Particular properties:
    - Print string when next character is '\n' (ascii - 10), otherwise add char in buf
    - Have a 'step' mode (change the 11 line in main from 'Mode.work_normal' to 'Mode.work_step'), useful for debug mode
        (change 8 line for 'Mode.DEBUG_OFF' - off Debug mode, 'Mode.DEBUG_STACK' - for print only stack events, 'Mode.DEBUG_FULL' - for print all messages)

New:
    - Add 'jump' function
    symbol on Befunge lang - 'j'
    How it's work: From stack Pop row, column and move cursor(pointer) to this position with current direction(vector)
        The Character under cursor right after jump will NOT be used, so, need jump with offset on previous character before the right
